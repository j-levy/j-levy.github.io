I am a French software developer with a main focus on relatively low-level programming. My background is a mix of computer engineering, computer science and mechatronics, with a hint of science teaching. My last research project revolved around possibilities of 3rd generation DNA sequences alignment using GPUs as Osaka University (Japan).

With a knack for multiculturalism and travel, I had the opportunity to study in France, the Netherlands and Japan, this last being where I currently live. Be it for programming or for speaking, I don't hesitate to try another language.

I am currently open for hire.
